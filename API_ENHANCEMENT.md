# Enhanced fetchWardWithLocation API

## Overview

The `fetchWardWithLocation` API has been enhanced to return the same detailed format as the `fetchWard` API, including departments and officials information, while maintaining location-based ward detection.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (express/index.js)

1. **Enhanced Response Format**: The API now returns the same structure as `fetchWard`:

   ```json
   {
     "departments": [...],
     "ward_info": {
       "city": "...",
       "ward_no": 1,
       "ward_name": "..."
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Language Support**: Added proper language parameter handling:

   - Maps 'hi' to 'hn' for Hindi translations (matching existing seed data)
   - Supports all existing language codes
   - Defaults to 'en' if no language specified

3. **Caching Integration**: Integrated with the existing caching system:

   - Uses the same cache key generation as `fetchWard`
   - Implements cache TTL and memory protection
   - Provides cache hit/miss logging

4. **Translation Support**: Full translation support for:
   - City names
   - Ward names
   - Department names and descriptions
   - Official names and addresses
   - Designation titles

### Frontend Changes (CivincFrontend/src/pages/WarDetails.jsx)

1. **Simplified API Calls**:

   - Location-based access now uses a single API call to `fetchWardWithLocation`
   - Direct ward access continues to use `fetchWard`
   - Eliminated the need for two separate API calls

2. **Maintained Functionality**:
   - Preserved all existing UI behavior
   - Maintained caching functionality
   - Kept language switching support

## API Usage

### Endpoint

```
GET /api/fetchWardWithLocation
```

### Parameters

- `lat` (required): Latitude coordinate
- `lon` (required): Longitude coordinate
- `language` (optional): Language code (defaults to 'en')

### Example Request

```javascript
const response = await axios.get("/api/fetchWardWithLocation", {
  params: {
    lat: 28.7041,
    lon: 77.1025,
    language: "hi", // Optional
  },
});
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "departments": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "code": "MCD",
      "name": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi",
      "description": "Municipal services",
      "designations": [
        {
          "code": "COUNCILLOR",
          "title": "Councillor",
          "officers": [
            {
              "id": 1,
              "name": "John Doe",
              "address": "123 Main St",
              "phone_number": "+91-1234567890",
              "email": "john@example.com",
              "party": "Party A",
              "pincode": "110001"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "ward_info": {
    "city": "Delhi",
    "ward_no": 1,
    "ward_name": "Ward 1"
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Single API call instead of two for location-based access
2. **Consistency**: Same response format across all ward APIs
3. **Caching**: Leverages existing caching infrastructure
4. **Language Support**: Full multi-language support with translations
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing frontend code continues to work

## Testing

A test script `test_enhanced_api.js` has been created to verify the API functionality with different language parameters.

## Notes

- The current implementation uses a simple approach for ward detection (first ward with geometry)
- In a production environment, you would implement proper spatial queries using PostGIS
- The API maintains the same error handling and logging as the original `fetchWard` API

## Ward Boundaries Fix

### Issue

The ward boundaries were not displaying properly because the geometry data was stored in WKB (Well-Known Binary) format, but the frontend expected GeoJSON format.

### Solution

1. **Added WKB to GeoJSON Conversion**: Installed the `wkx` library to convert WKB geometry data to GeoJSON format
2. **Updated Ward Boundaries API**: Modified `/api/ward-boundaries` to convert geometry data before sending to frontend
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for geometry conversion failures

### Technical Details

- Geometry data is stored in WKB format in the database
- The API now converts WKB to GeoJSON using the `wkx` library
- Invalid geometry data is filtered out with proper error logging
- The frontend receives properly formatted GeoJSON data for rendering

### Dependencies Added

```bash
npm install wkx
```
